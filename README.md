## Installation

## Usage

You will need to create a .env file with fields MY_PORT, PORT1, PORT2 and PORT3. PORTn is a port that server n is listening to; this system requires that n = 3; MY_PORT is the port of the given server being created; As such, to run this you will need to have the code in 3 directories, each with its own .env file representing a unique port. 

Once the .env is created for each server in their respective directories, do `npm start` to run. 

Once the servers are running you can send requests using the prefered agent of your choice. As the client, you can do two operations: 

  localhost/port/somar1 -> increases the server value by 1
  localhost/port/subtrair1 -> decreases the server value by 1

To run tests do `npm test`.
